# Memories
Voice Recognition Application The user takes a picture and uses Apples voice recognition features to dictate straight into the 
phone, what the picture is and the happy memory associated with it. It saves the user later on trying to remember his/her feelings after
the picture was taken. Also we are going to add Spotlight search for the voice recognition.
